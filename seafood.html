1) Oysters are my favortite type of seafood because there are so many types and so many ways to serve them, my favorite way to have them served is raw because thats the most common way to serve them.
2) Salmon is another very good seafood because it has very good taste. It can also be served in many ways weather you want it grilled,raw,on sushi and many more options.
