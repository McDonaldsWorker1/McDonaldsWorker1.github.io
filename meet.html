1) Any type of steak is very good but my personal favorite is flank and skirt steak with some secret reipe of steak rub. It is very good for special occaisons or whenver you want.
2) Bacon is one of the best if not the best brekfast food for many reasons. It it cooked in 3 ways, Light, Right and Burnt, in my opinion right is the best because it has the best taste out of the 3 choices. If you add some pancakes and syrup you will have the best brekfast.
